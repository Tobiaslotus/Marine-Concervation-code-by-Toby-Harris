                    creatures and sea fauna.

                    People all over the world became aware of the state that the sea creatures and plants were in in the
                    19 60s, around this time there was a person named Jacques Cousteau who brought the wonders of ocean
                    creatures and marine life to television.<br><br>

                    In the 1917s the U.S made laws which were enforced to protect marine life such as a law to stop
                    pollution and a law to carfully protect sea creatures who were endangered species but there are
                    still some issues to this day.

                    For example: acidification, climate change, sea level rising, decreasing bycatch in fisheries and
                    establishing protected areas for endangered species.<br><br>

                    There are three types of marine protection: Marine Reserves, Marine Sanctuarys and Marine National
                    Parks and Refuges.

                    The next page will help you to understand why and how people pollute the ocean and cause marine life
                    to suffer.</p>

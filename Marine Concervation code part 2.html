            <p style="font-size: 25px ;">The health of our marine life and the health of humanity are linked, Humanity
                deteriorates when the marine life deteriorates because some of humanity's lifestyles rely on marine life
                for example fishing and seafood such as seaweed which is used with sushi.

                People pollute the ocean by having bad waste habits including trash such as nonrecyclables and marine
                natural disasters such as tsunamis or hurricanes along with chemical spills from cargo ships, planes,
                cars and trucks taking things through the sea such as crude oil and chemical runoff.
